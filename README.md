# BanglaDictionary

Well!! Well!! This is my first github push for my project.
The main aim of this project was to learn
  * MongoDB
  * JSoup
Here I have used mongo unnecessarily. I have used only for learning purpose. 
Previously I have parsed many pages but not in large scale. In this project I have parsed so many pages. 
I have used Java Swing toolkit.

As I am very weak in English that's why I build this project. :laughing: :wink:

I will parse more and more website to fetch new words. Next target is to parse the "Shabdakosh" web page. 

One more reason to use mongodb is that when I will add new words then words duplicity will be an issue. 
Java Swing is used because I don't know much about PyQt and Python. I will try to implement next time. 

Next version target:

1. Parse "Shabdakosh" page and add new words.
2. History of previous searched words.
3. Python implementation for the implementation.

Any suggestions are welcome :blush::blush::blush:
